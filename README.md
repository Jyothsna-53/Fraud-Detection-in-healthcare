# Fraud-Detection-in-healthcare
This project aims to detect fraudulent claims in healthcare insurance using Autoencoders, a deep learning-based anomaly detection technique. Fraud detection is a critical issue in the insurance industry as it helps reduce financial losses and increase efficiency in claim processing.

Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models, making them suitable for detecting rare events such as fraud. By training the model on legitimate claims data, it can recognize unusual patterns that might indicate fraud.
